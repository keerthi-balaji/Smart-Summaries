This Project is in progress. Currently, the gpt-2 model is being trained.

# Description

Smart Summaries is an AI-driven tool designed to enhance the efficiency of healthcare professionals by summarizing electronic health records (EHRs). Leveraging state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 and transformer models such as BERT, this tool extracts and highlights the most relevant information for specific medical visits and specialties. The goal is to help busy physicians quickly understand patient histories and current conditions, ultimately improving patient care.
